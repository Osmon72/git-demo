Django!

Django, have you always been alone?

Django!

Django, have you never loved again?
Love will live on, oh oh oh...
Life must go on, oh oh oh...
For you cannot spend your life regreatting

Django!

Django, you must face another day

Django!

Django, now your love has gone away
Once you loved her, whoa-oh...
Now you've lost her, whoa-oh-oh-oh...
But you've lost her forever, Django

When there are clouds in the skies, and they are grey
You may be sad but remember that love will pass away
